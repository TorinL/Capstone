For this project I want to build something as if I was approached by a small business/entrepreneur to build them a modern and functional website for their business. With this scope in mind, I will be building a real estate site for an independent realtor in the Seattle area.

The site will use the Zillow api to bring in information on available housing in the Seattle market. I will also be using the google maps api to show available listings in a neighborhood. Users will be able to create an account and save potential favorite homes to their profile page and acquire housing valuations. Users will be able to click on a home and see additional details about the property. Users will also be able to put up their houses for sale through our realtor.  

I will be using pgsl for my database and express on the backend. The front end will be a SPA built with React. I would also like to use webpack for this project.

The MVP of this project is a crud app with two resources, houses and users. The next step is integrating search filtering options, by area code or by price range. My main stretch goal for this project is the google maps integration with available listings.
